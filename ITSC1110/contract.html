			<h2>Contract</h2>
			<p>
				I, Virac Bou agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2025, 
				ITSC 1110,  Computer Science Principles with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I
				understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be
				available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate
				for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my
				work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
				failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given
				the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online
				or even view my classmates’ code directly. I will only use these resources to
				learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit
				(i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. <br><br>Signed: <br>Virac Bou, 1/15/2025
